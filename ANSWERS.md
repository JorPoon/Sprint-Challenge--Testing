1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

The describe function is to breakdown the test suite into a function  components where as the it function tests an individual task. The describe function is good for holding all the testing tasks of one specific part of your code. The it function is good for testing one of those task.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

Test Driven Developement is to write out tests before writing out the code. This helps provide test coverage for your code. I think it is a good approach when working large projects. You want to let your team knows what the code you write should do. It helps summarize all the functions in your code. However it could be difficult to know what to test for at the beginning and TDD should be done after planning the project but before coding.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

Three types of automated tests are:
    1. Unit Testing
    2.Integration Tests
    3.Component Testing
